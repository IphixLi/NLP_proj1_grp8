Devil Anse Hatfield and Randall McCoy were close friends until near the end of the Civil War, when they return to their homes -- Hatfield in West Virginia and McCoy in Kentucky -- to increasing tensions and misunderstandings that quickly lead to all-out warfare between the clans (partially caused by a stolen pig). As hostilities grow and outside forces become involved in the fight, the states where the families live are brought to the brink of another war as the feud makes international headlines, the states' governors clash and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually intervenes.\n",
